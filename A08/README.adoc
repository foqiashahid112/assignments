= Allocations

In `simple.c`, where does the increase in 1040 bytes come from?
Why is the value 1040 bytes?
It is the difference of the initial and current memory addresses. This difference is of 410 in hexidemcial, i.e, 1040 bytes.
When the first printf is called, there is an interal malloc call to allocate space for a buffer for a print value. The default size of the buffer is 1040.

How many bytes does `mylloc_list.c` allocate when the program ends? Explain why
this amount makes sense.
mylloc_list.c allocated 2200 bytes of memory. This doesnt makes sense since we did not learn aobout this in class.
